## Wildcard Arguments 
- When you don't know how many arguments to pass in a function 
- Non-keyword arguments, *args 
- Keyword aarguments, **kwargs 

## Modules 
- One of the techniques for following DRY coding principles 
- Group similar codes and functions together in a separate file 
- Solves the problem of code file being too lengthy and complex 
- Can be reused across several programs 
- Python comes with a lot of modules as well, Pythons standard library 

## Packages 
- Collection of modules 
- Organise related modules under one directory 
- Initialise a package using init.py file

## Practical Example 
### Task:
- Create a package for basic text processing with modules for:
-- Counting words in a string
-- Counting characters in a string 
-- Reversing strings 

## Slicing a sequence 
- Ways to extract parts of data structures like strings, lists and tuples 
- Syntax: sequence [start:stop:step] (like range)
- Default of start: 0, step 1, stop: last 

## Object oriented programming 
- It is a way to help programmers structure the functionality of your program that would make sense to humans and would allow computers to run it efficiently 
- Almost all programming language use this concept 
- It uses "objects" to model real-world entities 

## Key concepts
### Class
- A blueprint for creating objects 
- Defines a set of attributes or methods that the created objects (instances) will have 
- E.g. Blueprint provided while building a house, defininig what an animal is 

### Object 
- An instance of a class 
- It represents a specific entity with attributes (data) and methods (functions) defined by class 
- E.g. A built house with many features (as functions)
- E.g. class_eg (Dog)
- E.g. BankAccount 

### 4 Pillars of OOP 

### Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism
